PAYCHEKX Support

PAYCHEKX is a lightweight, privacy‑first financial clarity system designed to run entirely in your browser with no accounts, no tracking, and no backend infrastructure.

Because of this architecture, support is intentionally minimal and focused on access, delivery, and technical issues only.

What PAYCHEKX Support Covers

We can help with:

Payment confirmation issues

Access problems after purchase

Tier routing issues (Single / Core / Full)

Single‑tool lock problems

Broken links or tool loading errors

What PAYCHEKX Support Does Not Cover

We do not provide:

Financial advice

Budgeting or debt counseling

Personalized recommendations

Bill negotiation services

Credit repair services

PAYCHEKX is a self‑service clarity tool system.

How Access Works

After payment, you are redirected to a delivery page that routes you to the correct access tier:

Single Tool

Core Bundle

Full Suite

Your access tier is passed using a URL parameter.

No account is created. No email login is required.

Single Tool Lock Explanation

If you purchased Single Tool Access:

You may choose one tool

That tool is permanently locked to your device using localStorage

You cannot switch tools later on the same device

This is a delivery hygiene mechanism, not DRM.

Lost Access

Because PAYCHEKX does not use accounts or emails:

Clearing your browser data will remove access

Using a new device will remove access

If this happens within the refund window, contact support.
